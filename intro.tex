Hello. This is going to be a good paper.
We had a a research project focused on developing a model to help find the best ways to improve the water sources and water quality of a country. Our approach was to rank each regional location, which we will call clusters, based on the ratio of expected benefits from a water intervention per dollar spent. This model is meant to aid countries and charitable organizations in their decision making process for selecting locations that may need the most help. Our approach centers on taking the Disability Adjusted Life Years calculations, developed by the World Health Organization, and applying them to the survey data provided by the Demographics and Health Survey. This was a large source of data that not being fully implemented(can we prove or quantify this). Creating an easily accessible model that helps these organizations understand and apply this large source of valuable information was the central goal.
	
As an overview, our water intervention model is focused on determining the best interevention for each of the clusters in a given country. There are a handful of types of interventions including Chlorine, Dug well, Bore hole, and stand pipes. The intervention with the best benefit to cost ratio for the given cluster was chosen, and this made possible a comparison of every cluster in the country. Equipped with this model and information, charitable organizations are able to more rapidly select the best regions to work in next.
