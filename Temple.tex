\begin{abstract}
\noindent Markov chains are used to model many different dynamical systems such as the movement of traffic, the spreading of disease, and the volatility of financial assets. In this paper, we construct a Markov model of the distribution of water in water poor areas of the world. Using current data about the water availability to individuals in these areas, we present the efficiency of the distribution process as well as examine various changes to that process and their effects on the efficiency. Then, we present what specific changes to these water distribution systems would be the most significant for the populations that they serve.
% TODO- Abstracts should also include results. So when we finish our paper we may want to change up the last part of the abstract to account for our results. Or if there are too many, the last sentence will suffice. -McKell

\section{Introduction}

The rest of the paper will be as follows.
First, Section \ref{sec:lit_rev} will present a review on modern literature pertaining to facility location problems.
Section \ref{sec:prob} will present the problem in terms of a facility location problem.
Section \ref{sec:sols} will examine three solutions approaches to the problem.
Namely, a euclidean distance model, a Markov chain model, and ... %TODO- Decide on last model or delete this part.
Section \ref{sec:res} will present the results and Section \ref{sec:analysis} will analyze the implications of the results.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} will give a summary of the paper along with areas for further research.
% TODO- This section should provide a general overview on any and all of the following: water distribution, facility location research, Markov models, etc. This section will be written in a technical report like fashion. This can function as our literature review and should be chalked full of references. This should be followed by an explicit definition of our problem &/or thesis statement where applicable (The problem doesn't need to be mathematically defined- just the word version). It should end with a paragraph that is like a table of contents for the rest of the paper. - McKell

\section{Relevant Literature Review}
\label{sec:lit_rev}
% TODO- This section is optional. It can all be covered in the beginning of the introduction. But if there is too much literature to cover, we definitely can have this section. Maybe we could just do this section on operational research topics and have our introduction be about water management?-McKell

\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:prob}
% TODO - This section should explicitly define our problem and variables used. I think it will probably be the P-median problem or a slight modification of it. - McKell
Insert text here.

\section{Solution Approaches}
\label{sec:sols}
Insert text here.
\subsection{Euclidean Distance Model}
Insert text here.
\subsection{Markov Modeling}
Insert text here.
\subsubsection{Background}
Insert text here.
\subsubsection{Model}
Insert text here.
\subsection{Last Model} % TODO- figure out last model or delete this section. Once updated the paper overview in the introduction will need to be updated. - McKell
Insert text here.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}
% TODO- This section should be purely the computational results - save the analysis for the next section. - McKell
Insert text here.
\subsection{Euclidean Distance Model}
Insert text here.
\subsection{Markov Model}
Insert text here.
\subsection{Last Model}
Insert text here.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}
% TODO - This section should contain what are results mean and their implications. -McKell
Insert text here.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
% TODO - This section should be about 1/2-1 page long. It should state no new information, but basically a summary of the paper. The "tell them what you told them" part of the paper. It should then include a paragraph about possibilities for further research.- McKell
