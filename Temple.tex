\section{Introduction}

For the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS church), temples are believed to be imperative in the process of one gaining salvation.
It is consequently important to the church that all members have access to a temple.
Not only do members of the church believe that temples are vital to salvation, but they also view temples as a place of worship.
% TODO - add in reference. https://www.lds.org/church/temples/why-we-build-temples/blessings-of-the-temple?lang=eng
So it is additionally important to be able to provide regular temple access to the maximum number of church members.

The LDS church currently consists of 15 million members.
% TODO - add in reference. http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics
In an effort to provide these members with temple access, the church has built a large number of temples and continues to build them.
In fact, the LDS church at this time has 155 temples in operation worldwide. 
They additionally have 14 temples under construction and 13 more that have been announced that they will be built.
% TODO -add in reference. http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/statistics/

When building new temples, church leaders have to consider the most effective locations to build them at.
Among many other considerations in this process, is the factor of giving the maximum number of people access or more regular access to a temple.
In the field of operations research, this factor is often considered a facility location problem.

% TODO - add in paragraphs about facility location management. Basically a mini-literature review.

In our paper, we use mathematical models to solve the temple location problem of the LDS church. We use an euclidean distance model to find the optimal temple locations in regards to the problem of maximizing the number of church members that have access to a temple. Additionally, we use a Markov chain model to find the optimal temple locations in regards to the problem of maximizing the number of church members that have more frequent access to the temple. Lastly, we will use a ... % TODO- write about new model if it exists.

The rest of the paper will be as follows.
First, Section \ref{sec:prob} will present the problem in terms of a facility location problem.
Section \ref{sec:sols} will examine three solutions approaches to the problem.
Namely, a euclidean distance model, a Markov chain model, and ... %TODO- Decide on last model or delete this part.
Section \ref{sec:res} will present the results and Section \ref{sec:analysis} will analyze the implications of the results.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} will give a summary of the paper along with areas for further research.

\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:prob}
\subsection{Relevant Literature Review}
\subsection{Important Variables}
\subsection{Assumptions and Data}
To simplify the models and make an analytical review of temple location optimization possible, a number of assumptions were made. Firstly, it is assumed that every LDS stake in the United States has the same number of active, temple-going members contained within its boundaries. This approximation, combined with the assumption that every stake center is located near the center of the stake, allows us to estimate the member density throughout the country. Within each model, further assumptions are made regarding the proportion of members that attend daily from each stake, and how the distance and busyness of each temple affects these proportions, but these details will be clarified for each individual model.

\section{Modeling Approaches}
\label{sec:models}
This section is a mathematical explanation of the assumptions made and the models used. As choosing the location of an LDS temple mathematically involves various assumptions about human behavior, as well as several possible objectives, we separate our explanation of the models used to solve this problem into subsections. Each subsection is self-contained in the assumptions made and the problem setup. Along with the individual models presented in each subsection, there is also a brief summary of the algorithmic approach used to find the optimal solution to each.

\subsection{Euclidean Distance Model} %TODO - Name needs to be changed as we are not in Euclidean space

The simplest model used is the Euclidean Distance Model (EDM). The purpose of EDM is to minimize the average distance a given member of a LDS stake has to travel to get to their closest temple. As such, this model does not take into account the capacity of the temples, nor the relative accessibility of other temples, even if they are a similar distance away. The only assumption made about the behavior of church members are that they desire to have a temple close to their stake center, and that they will only use the closest temple to them.

The mathematical setup is as follows. Let each stake be represented as $s_i$ and each temple $t_j$, and let the set of all the stakes be represented as $S$ and likewise the temples as $T$. The average distance a given member of a LDS stake has to travel to get to their closest temple is, 

\begin{equation}
	f(S,T) = \sum_i \underset{j}{\text{min}}\{d(S_i,T_j)\}.
\end{equation}

The unconstrained optimization problem can then be written as,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\underset{T_{new}}{\text{Minimize }} f(S,T^*), \text{ where } T^* = T \cup T_{new}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
