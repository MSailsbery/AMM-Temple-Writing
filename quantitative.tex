As previously stated, the methodology for cost-benefit analysis in water interventions had only been done on a local and selective fashion.
Thus, an approach that automated and generalized previous work was necessary.
This approach was based on the qualitative outline given by the World Health Organization from "Valuing Water, Valuing Livelihoods."
At it's core it focused on the ratio of benefits over costs in the form of Disability Adjusted Life Years gained over US Dollars.

\begin{center}
$\begin{matrix} \underline{\text{Years Gained}} \\ \text{Dollars} \end{matrix}$
\end{center}

Where Disability Adjusted Life Years are defined as:


\begin{center}
$\text{DALY} = \text{Travel Time} + \text{Sickness Time}$
\\
$\text{Travel Time} = \text{Time to Water} * \text{Trips per Year}$
\\
$\text{Sickness Time} = \text{Number of cases} * \text{Days Sick per Case} + \text{Deaths} * \text{Standard Life Expectancy}$
\end{center}
