The main set of results given by this method comes from a case study done on Namibia. This work was facilitated by the DHS survey data from 2012.

\subsection{Case Study: Namibia}

Although many countries in sub-saharan Africa have extreme need for better access to improve water sources******,  Namibia already has reached the point where improved water sources are available to 79\% of its citizens******(JMP 2017 final report).
Thus the goal of this case study was to identify the regions and communities that still remain in need of further improvements in their water sources.  

The first noteworthy result was that in almost every cluster the most cost-effective water intervention was the distribution chlorine filters. [Talk about this in the discussion, possibly moving some of this discussion].
This was the cheapest and most scalable intervention.
This suggests that for most of Namibia water access is not a significant issue, since the best improvement is to increase the filtering of the water.
This result matched with our expectations and with previous research which shows that the universal change that would most improve clean water access is chlorine filtering******.

In $x$ of the population clusters, a hand dug well was the most cost-effective best intervention.
These $x$ clusters [change to an exact amount] returned that a hand dug well dug would be the best intervention.
The most cost-effective interventions across the entirety of the country are in this group. 
[Include in discussion how this supports the idea of the effectiveness of the model, also the following sentence could be moved to the discussion and expanded upon]
This suggests that these clusters lack close, improved water sources, and a large amount of good would come from focusing improvement efforts there.

[Does this belong in the discussion section?]
As this method centers around calculating the Disability Adjusted Life Year, a quantity that is difficult to truly measure, it is calculated using numeric assumptions that have been gathered from research, or estimated by survey data (see Appendix A).
While the accuracy of each of these assumptions is based on the accuracy and amount of available research, it is possible to test the sensitivity of the results on these values we can test our model's sensitivity to the choice for each value.
With each sensitivity test, we adjusted a specific variable that was identified as one that could significantly change the outcome of the model.
We then tested whether raising it by 10 percent or lowering it by 10 percent would have a dramatic impact on the overall results.
A strong sensitivity to any certain variable would suggest that great care and further research must occur in finding its true value.
Low sensitivity, however, suggests the model is resilient to errors caused by estimating the value of the variable.
For example, an important variable for determining the benefit of an intervention is the fraction of individuals that will seek medical attention after experiencing diarrhea.
Based on literature, we estimated this value at 25 percent (see Appendix A).
To test the sensitivity of our model to this assumption, we ran the model twice with adjusted values for this variable; once with it lowered 10 percent and once with it raised 10 percent.
The outcome of this analysis was that the change in the ranking of a given cluster was less than one on average.
Thus, even if the percentage of people who visit a doctor is truly 27.5 percent, the cluster rankings will still be practically identical to the other classes.
