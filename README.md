# AMM-Temple-Writing
This is where we will construct the report for the temple project. Thank you to everyone who is contributing. Feel free to practice with git on this file or another text file if you are new to using github. Per the decision in the learning meeting where we covered this, do not attempt to push any .aux, .log,. out, or .pdf files. Doing so will create a lot more merge conflicts than we need.
